The "app" directory is the most important directory, and is where your
source files are located.

`scripts`, `styles` and `vendor` are all resolved relative to this directory.

A good place for that is simply `app/` (default value), but if you want the
root of your repository to be the root of your application, you can choose to
set this to `./`

Defaults to `./`.
